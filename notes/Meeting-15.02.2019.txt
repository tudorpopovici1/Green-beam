Week 1
Chair: Tudor
Notes: Sever

Yana's plan: The groups have to be at 8:45. The first group in the room will get her attention first.
Yana's job: She represents the login_page, but is also here to help us. First search it up on google. She is still human though, sometimes she won't know something.

Suggestion preparation for Monday: Understand git/gitlab/github. Download and explore IntelliJ. Do some research on going green: gas emisions, energy consumption and etc. Look in to the library Spring.

Today: update the Readme on gitlab. One file with everybody's information.
