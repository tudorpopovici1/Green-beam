I have mediocre experience in Java and I would like to brush my skills by practicing more and creating new applications.
My personal goal is to develop my skills in Java and learn about client and server protocols. I would also like to 
develop my team coordination skills.

I would like to improve my social skills by trying to work as good as possible inside a team. Usually I work alone so this course is a good opportunity.
Besides the social advantages I would also like to become a better programmer. Prior to CSE I didn't have a lot of experience in programming. Hopefully I will learn a lot from my team mates.

My goal is to deliver a final product that would surpass the initial expectations I have.
Besides that, I would like to learn how to efficiently cooperate with people I haven't known prior to this project, overall improving my social skills and critical thinking.
